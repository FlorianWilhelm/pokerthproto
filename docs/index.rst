PokerTHProto
============

The goal of this project is to provide a client interface to a
`PokerTH <http://pokerth.net/>`__ server. This interface could then be used
to write alternative poker clients in Python or even poker bots.

Right now, this project is in a **pre-alpha** status, meaning that it is
rather incomplete and does not yet fulfill its purpose. The only functionality
that works right now is to provide a simple proxy in order to inspect the
messages between a PokerTH client and server.
