============
PokerTHProto
============

The goal of this project is to provide a client interface to a
`PokerTH <http://pokerth.net/>`__ server. This interface could then be used
to write alternative poker clients in Python or even poker bots.

Right now, this project is in a **beta** status, meaning that it is
still incomplete.
